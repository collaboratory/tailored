# Tailored
An opinionated and feature rich frontend framework based on React and styled-components.

## Status
This project is in early development, slated for a first official release in January of 2019.
Until then, all features are subject to change, so keep an eye on pull requests and Glo to know what to expect.

## Mission
The mission of Tailored is to provide an opinionated frontend stack capable of managing all aspects of the user interface in a standardized, semantic, and predictable fashion in web, mobile, and electron applications.

## Current Goals
1. Remove or fully embrace dependency on `styled-system` (TBD)
2. Remove or fully embrace dependency on `polished` (TBD)
3. Full coverage and meaningful testing (90%+)
4. Observable specification and prototypes
5. Emitterware integration points (SPIKE)
